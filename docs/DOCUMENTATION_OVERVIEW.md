# Documentation Overview

## Introduction
This directory contains the supporting documentation for the Zenith Tasks development cycle. These files follow the Spec-Driven Development methodology, providing a clear roadmap and governance structure for the project.

## Document Structure
- Constitution: Defines the core values and development rules.
- Planning: Outlines the strategic approach and conceptual architecture.
- Specifications (Phases 1-5): Detailed breakdowns of the evolution of the application from a visual shell to a productivity power-house.

## Purpose and Scope
These documents exist to satisfy rigorous project planning requirements and to demonstrate professional-grade system design practices.

## Important Note
These files are standalone documentation assets. They are intended for review and governance purposes and do not interact with or modify the actual application code. The application logic remains independent of these descriptive specifications.
