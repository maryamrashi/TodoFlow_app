# Phase 5: Data Persistence & Final Polish

## Phase Goal
Ensure data longevity and provide the final layer of user experience refinement.

## Description
Closing the loop on the user journey with storage persistence and micro-animations.

## Features Planned
- Local storage persistence
- Micro-interactions (hover effects, click feedback)
- Advanced sorting options (Sort by Date, Sort by Priority)
- Empty state illustrations

## Functional Requirements
- Task data must persist across browser restarts.
- Users can sort the task list according to various criteria.

## Non-functional Requirements
- Animations must not exceed 300ms to maintain a "snappy" feel.
- Storage operations must be performant even with hundreds of tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Refreshing the page preserves all tasks and their states.
- The interface feels responsive and premium through subtle motion.

## Expected Outcomes
A production-ready application that feels professional and reliable.
