# Phase 3: Advanced Task Organization

## Phase Goal
Enhance the utility of the system through metadata-based organization and searching.

## Description
Implementing the tools needed for users with large volumes of tasks to filter, search, and categorize.

## Features Planned
- Task Priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Category tagging
- Real-time search by keyword
- Priority-based filtering

## Functional Requirements
- Each task must support a priority level.
- Search input must filter the visible list in real-time.
- Category icons must be visible and distinct.

## Non-functional Requirements
- Search must be case-insensitive.
- Filter controls must be accessible and intuitive.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Filtering by priority correctly reduces the task list.
- Search results update as the user types.

## Expected Outcomes
A powerful task management interface capable of handling organizational complexity.
