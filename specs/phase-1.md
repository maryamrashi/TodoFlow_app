# Phase 1: Visual Foundation & Aesthetic Core

## Phase Goal
Establish the premium 3D visual language and glassmorphic interface that will house the task management logic.

## Description
This phase focuses on the "skin" and "skeleton" of the application, ensuring the user environment feels modern, responsive, and high-end.

## Features Planned
- Responsive glassmorphic container
- 3D-styled card components
- Typography and color palette implementation
- Global layout structure

## Functional Requirements
- The application must render correctly on mobile and desktop viewports.
- The background must feature a multi-point radial gradient that shifts based on theme settings.

## Non-functional Requirements
- Initial load time must be under 1 second.
- Visual transitions must be smooth (60fps).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Header is centered and uses the branded typography.
- Main task container exhibits soft shadows and background blur.
- Footer is present and legible.

## Expected Outcomes
A high-fidelity visual shell ready for functional state injection.
