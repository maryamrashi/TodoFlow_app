# Phase 2: Core Task Management Interaction

## Phase Goal
Implement the primary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management.

## Description
Moving from a static shell to a dynamic interface where users can manipulate data in real-time.

## Features Planned
- Task entry form
- List rendering
- Toggle completion state
- Delete functionality

## Functional Requirements
- Users can add tasks via a dedicated input field.
- Tasks appear immediately in the list without page refresh.
- Clicking the status indicator toggles between active and completed states.

## Non-functional Requirements
- State updates must be atomic.
- Input validation to prevent empty task creation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tasks can be added, marked as done, and removed successfully.
- The UI reflects the current number of active/completed tasks.

## Expected Outcomes
A fully functional, albeit simple, interactive todo list.
